# Linux Development Environment Container for Visual Studio Code

This is what I use for general Linux-based development in Visual Studio Code, leveraging [Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers). For some projects I'm experimenting with project-specific containers (see [r4list](https://github.com/chucknelson/r4list)), while for others I'm trying to use a shared/"sandbox" container like this.
